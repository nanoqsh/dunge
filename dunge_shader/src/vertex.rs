/// The fields of [`Define`] must exactly match the actual struct fields.

/// attribute and the fields must have the same order as specified in [`Define`].
///
/// # Deriving
/// Although the library tries to formalize the safety invariant, you still shouldnâ€™t
/// implement the vertex yourself. The most reliable and simple way to do this is to
/// use a derive macro:
/// ```rust
/// # mod dunge {
/// #    // fake `Vertex` derive
/// #    pub use std::default::Default as Vertex;
/// # }
/// #
/// use dunge::Vertex;
///
/// #[repr(C)]
/// #[derive(Vertex)]
/// struct Vert {
///     pos: [f32; 2],
///     col: [f32; 3],
/// }
/// ```
