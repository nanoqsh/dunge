## Features
* Simple and flexible API
* Customizable vertices and groups
* Shader code described as a single rust function
* High degree of typesafety with minimal runtime checks
* Desktop, WASM and Android support
* Optional built-in window and event loop

## Application area
Currently the library is for personal use only. Although, over time I plan to stabilize API so that someone could use it for their tasks.

## Getting Started
ðŸš§ This section has not yet been written ðŸš§

## Examples
For more examples using the window, see the [examples](https://github.com/nanoqsh/dunge/tree/main/examples) directory.
To build and run an example do:
```sh
cargo run -p <example_name>
```

Also see the [test](https://github.com/nanoqsh/dunge/tree/main/dunge/tests) directory for small examples of creation a single image.
